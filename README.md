- 👋 Hi, I’m @reubenm17
- 👀 I’m interested in learning to code, starting with C and Python. C for embedded, and Python for everything else (at least that's how I understand it)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can be controlled by a microprocessor.
- 📫 How to reach me 'reuben.morrell@gmail.com' or my Discord Reubster#2869
